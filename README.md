# Chess Website

This is a simple chess web application built with Next.js and React. The main goal of this project was to improve coding skills, not to create a full-featured chess platform.

## Features
- Play chess as both black and white (no AI, no online play)
- Drag and drop or click to move pieces
- Visual highlights for possible moves and selected pieces
- Basic chess rules (including castling, check, and checkmate detection)

## How to Play
- Open the app in your browser.
- Both players (black and white) are controlled by you.
- Click or drag a piece to move it according to chess rules.
- The game will indicate check and checkmate.

## Purpose
This project was created to practice and improve coding skills, especially with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. It is not intended to be a complete or competitive chess game.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. Run the development server:
